# .dots
.dot files coming from my Arch Linux install.

I'll guide you through every aspect of the files in detail with pictured examples.

## `alacritty`
### start
- Will print on terminal `pfetch`'s information.
- Will set 'agnoster' as the theme for `zsh`.

Note that I customized my arch linux logo, you can do so by editing the binary in `/bin/pfetch`.

### colors & behaviour

You may want to redefine some variables in `.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml`, white text on white background 
is probable to show up sometimes when outputting text or running binaries without color encoding configuration.
